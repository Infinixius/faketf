- Add item grades
- Fix horrible popup inconsistencies between screen sizes
- Fix unusual effect being generated below item stats when changing a preset
- War paint support
- Better attribute editor (not text-based)
- Add in-game inventory
- Support exporting weapons to [DarthNinja's Item Designer plugin](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=1353985)
- Attribute randomizer
